
assembly:
	goal: output assembly protocols

	be able to input:
		plasmids
		sequences

	put x onto a plasmid


array generation:
	goal: given a gene, what are the best spacers to use

	need:
		input for sequence, repeats, # of spacers, organism, spacer length
		slide over sequence, generate ordered list based on criteria
			eliminate any with banned restriction sites
			homology with repeat consensus
			hairpinning
				using primer3
			homology with other parts of genome
				download genome
					ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/Bacillus_halodurans_C_125_uid57791/
				do a local blast
		output finished array
		use assembly module to build array

CRISPR information for easy access:
	annotated cas genes for different organisms along with repeats, leader sequences (not implemented)
	organism
		locus if possible
			gene
				description of gene (regulation, function, structure)
				sequence
				references
		repeat consensus
		spacer length

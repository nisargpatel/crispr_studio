==================================INSTALLATION==================================

Binaries of CRISPRstudio are available at our GoogleCode site, located at:
http://code.google.com/p/crispr-studio/

Select the downloads tab and download the appropriate build based on your OS.
All builds are provided for x87 platforms. For x64 real support, you will need
to runthe source directly. x64 support has not shown significant speed increases
for CRISPRstudio.

Extract the compressed file to some location. You also need to download BLAST+,
version 2.2.25 from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/.
BLAST+ must be installed and included in the system path.

After this, you may run MainFrame to start the program.

=====================================SOURCE=====================================

PYTHON PLATFORM

Pick os/arch as needed. Note that each of the python packages should list the
version of Python they support - select the right one.

Python 2.7.2 - http://www.python.org/download/
NumPy 1.6.1 - http://new.scipy.org/download.html
Biopython 1.57 - http://biopython.org/wiki/Download
BLAST+ 2.2.25 - ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/
WxPython 2.8 - http://www.wxpython.org/download.php
  The x64 version doesn't seem to like Win7 so you may be better with x86.

BLAST+ must be included in the system path.

You may then run the MainFrame.py to start the program.

====================================FIRST RUN===================================

When running CRIPRstudio, you will be prompted to update the local data. This
will download the latest information on CRISPR from NCBI, CRIPRDB, JCVI, and 
CRISPI. Packages downloaded will come with some verion of the local data based
on when we pushed that release.


Have Fun!
